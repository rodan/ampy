an audio amplifier project that contains a mixer controlled by an MSP430 microcontroller

contents:
 hardware/power_amp  - power circuit for the amplifier
 hardware/power_pre  - power circuit used by the mixer board
 hardware/amp        - 2x25W amplifier. for a quad setup this board is used twice, for 6 channels it's used 3 times.
 hardware/mixer      - mixer board. 10 inputs, 6 outputs, 12 channels of mixing. a stereo-to-quad panning circuit is included

 firmware_mixer      - software that runs on the MSP430F5510 that is present on the mixer board
 firmware_brain      - software for the main uC that interfaces the user with the mixer board. currently user input comes via remote control presses.

--------------------------------------------

Mixer board input

two different input methods are available, either via UART or I2C. since they use the exact same 2 pins the switch between them is a compile time option - see config.h. the i2c interface is highly recommended.

I2C implementation

the communication protocol consists of either a direct 14 byte read in which case the current settings are being shared, 2 byte writes for sending commands or 4 byte writes for sending new volume values. the slave address is 0x28.
