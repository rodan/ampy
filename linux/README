Linux mixer control software for the ampy ecosystem.

Either an FTDI-based USB-to-uart or a USB bluetooth connection that supports SPP is used to connect to firmare_brain in order to control the mixer and the power amp boards.

All the PGA2311 chips present on the mixer board can be set in the [mixer view] and on the [amp view] the sound detection and mute signals can be toggled.
The second only works if the power amp is based on the LM4780 IC.
